# async-programming

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, different programming paradigms have emerged to tackle the
challenges posed by concurrency, asynchrony, and responsiveness.
This project provides practical demonstration of different programming paradigms, including imperative programming,
reactive programming, and virtual threads, allowing developers to compare and contrast these approaches within a single
codebase.

- **Imperative Programming**: The traditional approach, where code is executed sequentially and explicitly outlines
  every step of a process.

- **Reactive Programming**: An asynchronous and event-driven paradigm that leverages reactive streams to handle data
  flows and achieve high concurrency.

- **Virtual Threads**: An innovation introduced through Project Loom, offering lightweight concurrency through virtual
  threads, enabling highly scalable and responsive applications.
